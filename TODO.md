- Declutter the sidebar (more realistic)
- Add react-router with some basic pages like /settings
- Add generic terms + privacy pages
- Check Supabase support
- See what's up with the neondb unique key issue for existing user (should just log in and retrieve)
- Firebase auth link requires 'Get started' click; can we automate this?
